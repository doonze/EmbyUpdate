EmbyUpdate Version 3.0 Beta (Rolled 5/20/2020)
Version 3.0 will be a major overhaul of the EmbyUpdate script. I forked this script to
use to also update Jackett and learned a lot of things as well as found several errors.
I will be correcting those errors here. 
* Made the way I handle python 2/3 compatibility smarter in all scripts
    * use "from configphaser import ConfigPhaser" now instead of allowing exceptions to handle the
    logic
    * used "from builtins import input" to handle 2's raw_input and 3's input compatibility in configupdate
    * removed lots of previous logic and code around making the script python 2/3 compatible
* Added some Try blocks to better handle issues, and report exceptions more clearly in embyupdate.py
* Corrected a issue in configupdate.py with a variable from server stop dialog being reused in the server
  start code block. Would have caused server stop choices to be used for server start is some cases

along with some additional output if the exit is triggered
