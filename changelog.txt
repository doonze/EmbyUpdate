EmbyUpdate Version 4.12 Stable (Rolled 10/13/2023)
* Rolled 4.11 Beta to 4.12 Stable and updated README with new process. Man was that old.
* Been sitting in this chair for 17 hours today working on this release, and worked on this about 4 hours yesterday.
Man my butt hurts.

EmbyUpdate Version 4.11 Beta (Rolled 10/13/2023)
* Fixed some logic errors with how the app handled updates when I could find the server, then couldn't an a later run.
or vise versa.

EmbyUpdate Version 4.1 Beta (Rolled 10/13/2023)
* Huge update to how the app works
* Now using SQLite DB for config
* Command line options for viewing/updating the configs
* Update history will now be recorded for both the app and Emby
* Will now query the running instance of Emby (if possible) to get the current version. Main use is so that we don't
bother updating Emby the first time the app is run if the current version and latest online version are the same. May
have more uses later for this functionality.
* App will restart itself if it's been updated. Previously updates would not come into effect until the next time the
app was run.

EmbyUpdate Version 4.0 (beta, not rolled)
* Mainly moved from a config file to a SQLite database

EmbyUpdate Version 3.2 (Rolled 10/1/2020)
* Added flags to bypass any install conformations requiring user manual intervention in the install
  process. As this is a automatic script those would fail. Updated Fedora, SUSE, and CentOS.

EmbyUpdate Version 3.1
* Added a systemd folder with systemd unit and timer files for using systemd instead of cron to trigger 
  the script

EmbyUpdate Version 3.0 Beta (Rolled 5/20/2020)
Version 3.0 will be a major overhaul of the EmbyUpdate script. I forked this script to
use to also update Jackett and learned a lot of things as well as found several errors.
I will be correcting those errors here. 
* Made the way I handle python 2/3 compatibility smarter in all scripts
    * use "from configphaser import ConfigPhaser" now instead of allowing exceptions to handle the
    logic
    * used "from builtins import input" to handle 2's raw_input and 3's input compatibility in configupdate
    * removed lots of previous logic and code around making the script python 2/3 compatible
* Added some Try blocks to better handle issues, and report exceptions more clearly in embyupdate.py
* Corrected a issue in configupdate.py with a variable from server stop dialog being reused in the server
  start code block. Would have caused server stop choices to be used for server start is some cases


EmbyUpdate Version 2.2 Beta (Released 1/10/2019)
* Added logic to each subprocess to exit the script on a non-zero return code
along with some additional output if the exit is triggered
